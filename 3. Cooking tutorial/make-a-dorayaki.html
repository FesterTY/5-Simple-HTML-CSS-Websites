    <h1 class="header">Making Dorayakis — From Zero to Hero</h1>

    <div class="paragraph">
      <p>At first sight, making Dorayaki seems easy as pie – after all, it does look like you’re making regular
        pancakes: one bowl, flour, egg, milk, sugar, mix, and fry. But don’t be fooled, Dorayaki is not a regular
        pancake. It takes some time for you to perfect the recipe, because I came to realise that if we overmix the
        batter, even though our pancakes are still going to look fluffy, they will taste a bit tough when we dig in.
        These pancakes are tell-tale by the tiny air bubbles on their surface.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="paragraph">
      <p>Don’t worry, they are still very much edible and tasty, but the texture of the true Japanese Dorayaki I have
        tried is more of a flat sponge cake than a pancake. Therefore, I decided to incorporate light and airy beaten
        egg whites into the batter. We will have to put in a bit more effort and the pancakes take longer to fry, but
        trust me, the light, spongy cake is worth it. Plus, we can store them longer (regular pancakes can turn very
        hard and tough after just a couple of hours), which is wonderful if we decide to make a large batch and
        refrigerate or freeze them – convenient and yummy Dorayaki whenever we want without reaching for our pantry !</p>
    </div>

    <div class="paragraph">
      <p>That being said, feel free to choose any one of the two methods. After all, who needs to put Dorayaki in the
        fridge when you can eat them all! OwO</p>

        <h3 class="sub-header">Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>2 eggs (60 – 65 gram/egg, shell included) – fridge temperature (this will help the pancake rise better)</li>
          <li>30 gram (2 Tbsp) caster sugar</li>
          <li>10 gram (1/2 Tbsp) honey</li>
          <li>70 gram (1/2 cup + 1 Tbsp) cake flour</li>
          <li>½ tsp baking powder</li>
          <li>½ tsp vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="instructions">
        <h3 class="sub-header">Doing the cooking</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>In a large bowl, add the eggs, sugar, honey and vanilla extract. Whisk until well-combined, the egg
            mixture
            doesn’t have to be fluffy.</li>
          <li>Sieve in the cake flour and baking powder and mix well. Try to stir as quickly as possible and don’t
            overmix,
            otherwise the Dorayaki will be quite tough. Cover the bowl and leave it in the fridge for 15 minutes.</li>
          <li>When you take it out, the batter should be of a pourable consistency.
            If it is too thick, you can loosen it by adding 1 tsp of water (but try to avoid this – like I said, the
            more
            you mix, the tougher the pancakes would be).</li>
          <li>Fry the pancakes the same way as the first recipe. When pouring the batter into the pan, keep the spoon
            in
            one place and pour straight down into the pan,
            you will have a beautifully round pancake. Remember, don’t stir the batter!</li>
        </ol>
      </div>

      </div>

      <h3 class="sub-header">Editor's Notes</h3>
      <ul class="additional-note">
        <li>In the first recipe, try not to break the air bubbles while folding the egg mixture and the flour together.
          Those air bubbles are our best friends when making fluffy pancakes!</li>
        <li>Use butter instead of vegetable oil to fry the pancakes – it adds richness to the pancake and plus, your
          kitchen will smell lovely.</li>
        <li>A flat, non-stick frying pan is most preferable.
          For even heat distribution, fry your pancakes on the electric or induction hob, as the heat tends to
          concentrate on the bottom of the pan only on a gas stove.</li>
        <li>Fry on low heat to prevent burning the pancakes while the inside is still raw (on my electric hob, I left
          the
          pan on level 2/6). When using a thermometer, the pan was about 100°C (212°F).
          If the pan overheats too much, prepare a damp towel in advance and place the pan on top of the towel to cool
          it
          down before you pour in the batter.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="sub-header">Filling and Storage</h3>
      <ul class="additional-note">
        <li>Leave the pancakes to cool on a cooling rack after taking them out of the pan.</li>
        <li>Dorayaki’s traditional filling is made of red bean (azuki). Doremon loves his Dorayaki with thick, creamy
          and
          shiny red bean paste, which requires a lot of sugar to make and can be somewhat overly sweet if you don’t
          have
          a particular sweet tooth. I used Nutella instead, as shown in the video, which is no less amazing. Other
          possible options include peanut butter, whipped cream, custard cream (choux crème filling) or matcha custard
          cream if you still feel like sticking to traditional Japanese flavour.</li>
        <li>For sponge Dorayaki pancakes made using the first method, you can cover them with plastic wrap and
          refrigerate for 1 – 2 days. About half an hour before serving, take the pancakes out and leave them at room
          temperature.
          You can also warm up the Dorayaki in the microwave for 20 – 30 seconds at 600W. Remember to leave the plastic
          wrap to prevent the pancakes from drying out.</li>
        <li>If you want to store the pancakes longer (for 2 – 3 months), put them in an airtight container into the
          freezer. Defrost before serving.</li>
        <li>I usually don’t fill the Dorayaki until before I serve them – nothing beats freshly-made fillings.</li>
        <li>For pancakes made by the latter method, consume as soon as possible, as they are not as suitable for
          long-life storage.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="sub-header">Common Errors</h3>
      <ul class="additional-note">
        <li>Pancakes brown unevenly, with brown and white patches: there is too much grease in the pan. Wipe the excess
          with some paper towel.</li>
        <li>Pancakes are tough and not fluffy:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>If you follow the first method: this is because the meringue hasn’t been whipped enough, or has deflated
            while folding too vigorously.</li>
          <li>If you follow the second method: you have overmixed the batter.</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
