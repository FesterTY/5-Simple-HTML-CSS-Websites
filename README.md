<i><h4 align="center">A picture of my keyboard selling website</h4></i>

This was made to test my CSS skills and experiment more with HTML. These 5 websites I made cover only basic and positional CSS, so no flexbox. Javascript was used to get the effect I wanted (although very little). The websites might not be responsive for anything lower than the resolution of a fullscreen browser, however I plan to make them more responsive in the future.

**Warning: some of the websites use custom fonts, so it might not be styled correctly if you don't have them.**
