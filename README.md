# 5-Simple-HTML-CSS-Websites

## Disclaimer: Any pictures/fonts are not mine and is used for educational purpose. If the owner of that respective content wishes to have it taken down, I'm willing to remove it.

This was made to test my CSS skills and experiment more with HTML. These 5 websites I made cover only basic and positional CSS, so no flexbox. Javascript was used to get the effect I wanted (although very little). The websites might not be responsive for anything lower than the resolution of a fullscreen browser, however I plan to make them more responsive in the future.

### Warning: some of the websites use custom fonts, so it might not be styled correctly if you don't have them.
